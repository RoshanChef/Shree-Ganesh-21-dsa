Problem in Simple Words:

    -- You are given an array of weights, where each element is the weight of a package.
    --
    -- Packages must be shipped in order (you canâ€™t rearrange them).
    --
    -- You have a ship that can carry a certain capacity per day.
    --
    -- You want to ship all packages within D days.

ðŸ‘‰ Find the minimum ship capacity needed to do this.


Rules:

You can load packages one by one in the given order.

    -If the next package doesnâ€™t fit in the remaining capacity of the day, the ship sails, and you continue on the next day.

    -You must finish shipping all packages within exactly D days or less.
